          small bags or the larger tonne bags, we can help. We offer free local
          delivery for the larger bags.

        <p>
          The wood is air dried as we believe that is better for the environment
          than kiln dried and we can supply both soft and hard wood. Which is
          right for you will depend what you are burning the wood in and how
          quickly you want it to burn. As a general rule, softwood is easier to
          light but burns more quickly so you will use more. Some of our
          customers swear by one or the other and others tell us they can't
          really tell much difference! Outside the Christmas season, please feel
          free to come and get some of the smaller bags of wood or kindling
          whenever the gate in open as that usually means we are on site. If you
          are coming a distance or don't pass us, please feel to give us a call
          first to check we are around. Larger bags can be ordered in
          person,over the phone or via our facebook page and we will deliver to
          your home. Please be aware there needs to be somewhere to put the
          delivery (that doesn't block your car in the drive!) and that we empty
          the bag on delivery. Free delivery is only available locally.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can take payment over the phone by credit card or can take cash on
          delivery. We also ask that you are at home the first time we deliver-
          to make sure we have the right house and the right spot! Please give
          us a call or email us to get the most up to date prices and to confirm
          we deliver to your area. If you email, please let us know whether you
          want hardwood or softwood.
